\title{Grey Wolf Optimizer}
\usage{
GWO(N, Max_iter, lb, ub, dim, fobj)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer indicate population size.}

\item{Max_iter}{An integer indicate maximum number of iterations.}

\item{lb}{A numeric vector that show lower bounds of the search space. One value per dimension.}

\item{ub}{A numeric vector that show upper bounds of the search space. One value per dimension.}

\item{dim}{An integer show the number of dimension (parameters) of the problem to optimize. It indicate the number of parameters to be optimized.}

\item{fobj}{An objective function used to be minimized. It is return single numeric value that show evaluation matrix result in every iteration.
It used to calculate the best fitness in every iteration.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{best_fitness}{The best (minimum) fitness value found.}
  \item{best_position}{The parameter vector (position) corresponding to the best fitness.}
  \item{jml_iter}{The number of iterations executed.}
  \item{param}{Matrix of best parameters found across every iterations (dim Ã— iter).}
  \item{param_list}{Vector of best fitness values at each iteration.}
}
}
\description{
An algorithm built by Mirjalili et al. (2014) inspired by leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of
grey wolves in nature to optimized real-valued objective function in continous search space in a population-based manner.
}
\details{
This algorithm proposed social hierarchy on GWO to obtain the best fitness and get the best proposed hunting method to locate
probable position of the pray. Adaptive values on alpha and A make it possible smooth transition between exploration and exploitation phase.

The algorithm performs until maximum iteration reached or convergence condition when the difference
in objective values for ten consecutive times is less than 10^-5.
}
\note{
The input vectors 'lb' and 'ub' must have the same length as the number of dimensions 'dim'.

This optimization function used inside svrHybrid function.
