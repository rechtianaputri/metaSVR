\usage{
EHHOCBO(N, Max_iter, lb, ub, dim, fobj)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer indicate population size.}

\item{Max_iter}{An integer indicate maximum number of iterations.}

\item{lb}{A numeric vector that show lower bounds of the search space. One value per dimension.}

\item{ub}{A numeric vector that show upper bounds of the search space. One value per dimension.}

\item{dim}{An integer show the number of dimension (parameters) of the problem to optimize. It indicate the number of parameters to be optimized.}

\item{fobj}{An objective function used to be minimized. It is return single numeric value that show evaluation matrix result in every iteration.
It used to calculate the best fitness in every iteration.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{best_fitness}{The best (minimum) fitness value found.}
  \item{best_position}{The parameter vector (position) corresponding to the best fitness.}
  \item{jml_iter}{The number of iterations executed.}
  \item{param}{Matrix of best parameters found across every iterations (dim × iter).}
  \item{param_list}{Vector of best fitness values at each iteration.}
}
}
\description{
This function implements a hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm that combines Harris Hawks Optimization with leader selection of Coot Bird
Optimization to optimized real-valued objective function in continuous search space in a population-based manner built by Cui et al. (2023).
}
\details{
This algorithm start by adding leadership mechanism of CBO into HHO process so it can make better foundation for the global search.
Ensemble Mutation Strategy (EMS) to improve the exploration trend and population diversity also Refracted Opposition-Based Learning (ROBL)
to update current optimal solution in the swarm added to enhanced the combination of HHO and CBO.

The algorithm performs until maximum iteration reached or convergence condition when the difference
in objective values for ten consecutive times is less than 10^-5.
}
\note{
The input vectors `lb` and `ub` must have the same length as the number of dimensions `dim`.

This optimization function used inside svrHybrid function.

sphere_fn <- function(x) sum(x^2) # simple function for objective function

# EHHOCBO optimization
